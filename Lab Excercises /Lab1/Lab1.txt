Part 1 — A description of your computing background (languages you are familiar with).
I did C# and some Java in high school. It was just using Visual Studio to create basic programs and web apps. It was back in 2016-2017. So, I am familiar with C# albeit rusty, as for Java, I hardly remember it and all I can recall is that C# and Java have similar syntax. 
I did CMPUT174 in the University of Alberta so I didn’t take CMPT101 or CMPT103 in MacEwan. It was just intro into Python. The first compsci course I took here in MacEwan is CMPT200. I’m very familiar with Python as it’s the most recent language I’ve used. 

Part 2 — The first line from a man page “Description” section for any command other than pwd.
$ man cd
Change  the current working directory to dirName, or to the home directory (as specified in the HOME environment variable) if dirName is  not given. 

Part 3 — The values of the 26th and 27th bytes.
