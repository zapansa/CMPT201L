Program Description:

- Echos input which contain a given character within the first 15 characters
  of the line. 
- Takes input from standard input written on standard output
- The input can be of any size. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Tests: 

In testInputSelectLine1, it tests for the examples given on the assignment
sheet and yields the correct answer as on the assignment sheet.
 
Tests also included in the file are 
      - The case if the given character and the input is all of the same
      character. 
      - The case if the given character is different than all of the input.
      - The case if the given character is in the 15th position of the input. 
      - The case if the given character is passed the 15th position in the
      input. 
All of which are correctly outputted.

The testInputSelectLine1 is also a multi-lined file, and the program
successfully computes all of them yielding the correct answer.

In testInputSelectLine2-5, it tests single lined input, and the program
computes all of them correctly. 

In makefile, "make testall", runs all of the previous tests and then checks
for differences from the files with correct answer (eg. ansSelectLine1 and so
on). There was no discrepancies with the correct files and the output files. 

In addition to that, "make test", runs the program to test input from the user.
