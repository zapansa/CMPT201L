Program Description:

- Finds all pairs of prime numbers less than integer n with a difference of integer d.
- n and d are specified by input. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Tests: 

In testPrimesDiff1, it tests for the examples given on the assignment sheet and yields the correct answer as on the assignment sheet.
 
Similar inputs are also included in the above file. All of which are correctly outputted.

The testPrimesDiff1 is also a multi-lined file, and the program successfully computes all of the input yielding the correct answer, and printing them properly.

In testInputPrimesDiff2-3, it tests single lined input, and the program computes all of them correctly. 

In makefile, "make testall", runs all of the previous tests and then checks for differences from the files with correct answer (eg. ansPrimesDiff1 and so on). There was no discrepancies with the correct files and the output files. 

In addition to that, "make test", runs the program to test input from the user.
