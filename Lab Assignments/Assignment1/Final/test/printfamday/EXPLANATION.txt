Program Description:

- Takes year as input and prints the day of the Alberts Family day for the
  next 30 years.
- In printing the years for the next 30 years, it includes the input year.
- Displays the years in a nicely organized table. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Tests: 

In testPrintFamDay1, it tests for the example (2013) given on the assignment
sheet and yields the correct answer as on the assignment sheet.
 
Tests also included in the file are 
      - if the year is 2014. (Family Day: Feb.17)
      - if the year is 2015. (Family Day: Feb.16)
      - if the year is 2016. (Family Day: Feb.15)
      - if the year is 2017. (Family Day: Feb.20)
All of which are correctly outputted.

In testPrintFamDay2, some bigger years are used. 

The testPrintFamDay1-2 are also a multi-lined files, and the program
successfully computes all of the input yielding the correct answer.

In testInputSelectLine3-4, it tests single lined input, and the program
computes all of them correctly. 

In makefile, "make testall", runs all of the previous tests and then checks
for differences from the files with correct answer (eg. ansPrintFamDay1 and so
on). There was no discrepancies with the correct files and the output files. 

In addition to that, "make test", runs the program to test input from the user.
